### Brain Wave:

This headset detecte brain waves. There come from the communication between our cells, more specificly when a group of neurone send a message to another group. This detection as for unit Hz. There are five type of brain wave :

* **DELTA** : it the slowest brain wave type. They are product when we are in the deepest sleep state (when we don't have any dream). `0.5 and 4 Hz`
* **THETA** : when you are sleeping more or when you are extremely relaxed. `4 and 8 Hz`
* **ALPHA** : there are produce when you are awake, but not focusing on something. They are used to communicate automatic action. `8 and 12 Hz`
* **BETA** : when you are awake, alert and foxus, for exemple when you take decision.  `12 and 35 Hz`
* **GAMMA** : when you are actively learning, concentring and solving `upward of 35 Hz`

### EGG:
An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test used to evaluate the electrical activity in the brain. Brain cells communicate with each other through electrical impulses. An EEG can be used to help detect potential problems associated with this activity.
